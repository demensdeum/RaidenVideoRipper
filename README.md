**Raiden Video Ripper** is an open-source project designed for video editing and format conversion. It's built using Qt 6 (Qt Creator) and allows you to trim and convert videos to MP4 or GIF formats.  

### Install
Open RaidenViewRipper.pro file and build project in Qt 6 - Qt Creator. Please note that to use this tool, you'll need to have the FFMPEG_BINARY environment variable properly set.    
  
Here are the steps:  

1. Download FFmpeg for Windows.  
1. Extract it to a directory of your choice.  
1. Set the FFMPEG_BINARY environment variable to the absolute path of the FFmpeg executable (FFmpeg.exe).  

Raiden Video Ripper simplifies video editing and conversion, making it an accessible tool for open-source enthusiasts.  

It's possible that the application may work on both Linux and MacOS, but it has never been tested on these operating systems.
